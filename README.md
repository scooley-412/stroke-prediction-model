# Stroke Prediction Model

This project explores the use of supervised machine learning to classify a patient’s risk of stroke based on structured health and demographic data. The goal is to build a working model that highlights how classification techniques can be applied to healthcare use cases.

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and includes features such as age, BMI, hypertension, and smoking status. While synthetic, it’s modeled after realistic patient records.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
- Comparison of multiple classification models
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded directly from Kaggle:

[Stroke Prediction Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data)

It includes synthetic patient-level data such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Hypertension  
- Heart disease  
- Marital status  
- Work type  
- Residence type  
- Average glucose level  
- BMI  
- Smoking status  
- Stroke occurrence (target)

This dataset is suitable for educational and demonstration purposes and does not contain real patient information.
