# Stroke Prediction Model

This project explores the use of supervised machine learning to classify a patient’s risk of stroke based on structured health and demographic data. The goal is to build a working model that highlights how classification techniques can be applied to healthcare use cases.

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle and includes features such as age, BMI, hypertension, and smoking status. While synthetic, it’s modeled after realistic patient records.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
- Comparison of multiple classification models
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC
- Feature importance analysis
